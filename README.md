An image processing program that will analyse your VIT time table and show the free and filled slots.

# Language
Python

# Python version
3+  
The <b>print</b> statement of Python2 was replaced with the <b>print()</b> function in Python3, which is what is used in this code.

# Documentation
The complete documentation is available in this repository: <a href="https://github.com/progyadeep/time_table_analyser/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md">DOCUMENTATION.md</a>

# Dependencies
<ul>
  <li>numpy</li>  
  <li>PIL.Image</li>
</ul>

# Limitations
The input image should be a proper screenshot (taken on laptop, <b>not phone</b>), and <b>the entire time table should be present inside the picture</b>. Incomplete screenshots will lead to an <b>image index out of bounds</b> error.
